# CSGO-achievement-maps
 Original copies of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Aztec, Shorttrain, Dust, and Office maps compatible with the game's four "unattainable" achievements.
 
 Historically, these maps were hosted by the official [CSGO development Steam Workshop account](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082857351/myworkshopfiles/?appid=730), but have since been removed. With their removal, several CSGO achievements became unattainable.
 
## Installation

Navigate to the CSGO directory inside the Steam install directory:

    steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\maps
    
 Once there, rename the current, valid bsp files (example: cs_office.bsp) to something else if you don't want to reverify your game files, and drop all four maps into the folder. Once in-game, launch the maps through the console command as follows:

    map mapname
    
 For example:
 
    map cs_office
    
 Fulfill achievement criteria and the achievement should pop. Office is the easiest map to test, requiring the player to break a certain number of windows in a single round. Other maps will require adjustments to cfg files for the required gamemodes to load properly.
