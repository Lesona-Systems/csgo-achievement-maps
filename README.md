# CSGO-achievement-maps
 Original copies of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Aztec, Shorttrain, Dust, and Office maps compatible with the game's four "unattainable" achievements.
 
 Historically these maps were hosted by the official CSGO development Steam Workshop account, but have since been removed. With their removal, several CSGO achievements became unattainable either by the complete removal of the maps from the game's map rotation or by changes to the internals of the maps themselves. 
 
## Installation

Navigate to the CSGO directory inside the Steam install directory:

    steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\maps
    
 Once there, rename the current, valid bsp files (example: cs_office.bsp) to something else if you don't want to reverify your game files, and drop all four maps into the folder. Once in-game, players can launch the maps through the console command as follows:

    map mapname
    
 For example:
 
    map cs_office
    
 Fulfill achievement criteria and the achievement should pop. Office is the easiest map to test, requiring the player to break a certain number of windows in a single round. Other maps will require adjustments to cfg files for the required gamemodes to load properly.
