# CSGO-achievement-maps
 Copies of the original Aztec, Shorttrain, Dust, and Office maps compatible with the game's four "unattainable" achievements.

## Installation

Navigate to the CSGO directory inside the Steam install directory:

    steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\maps
    
Once there, rename the current, valid de_office.bsp file to something else, and drop all four maps into the folder. Once in-game, players can launch the maps through the console command as follows:

    map mapname
    
 For example:
 
    map cs_office
